## dotfiles setup

This project contains multiple setup files for both Windows and Linux / MacOS. When working on Windows, I use WSL for all tools, except Alacritty. 

To automatically copy all config files to their destination, run the `setup.sh` with one of the following flags (or none):

```sh
-w -- windows configs and dotfiles
-n -- non-windows configs and dotfiles
```

This contains my configuration files for:
* [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
* [zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) 
* [neovim](https://neovim.io/).

This also contains my config for the [regolith](https://regolith-linux.org/) distro with some basic tools for development.
