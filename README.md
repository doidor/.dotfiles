## dotfiles setup

This project contains multiple setup files for both Windows and Linux / MacOS. This contains my configuration files for [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), [zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and [neovim](https://neovim.io/).

This also contains my config for the [regolith](https://regolith-linux.org/) distro with some basic tools for development.
